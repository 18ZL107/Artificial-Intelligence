# Overview
An introduction course to the basic principles and tools of artificial intelligence. Problem solving methods and knowledge representation techniques.

## Assignment 1
### Introduction
There are two parts to this assignment.
- Propagators. You will implement two constraint propagators—a Forward Checking constraint propagator, and a Generalized Arc Consistency (GAC) constraint propagator—and two heuristics— Minimum-Remaining-Value (MRV) and Degree (DH).
- Models. You will implement three different CSP models: two grid-only Cagey models, and one full Cagey puzzle model (adding cage constraints to grid).

## Assignment 2
### Introduction
This assignment is intended to gauge your understanding of planning and the PDDL modeling system. Your goal will be to implement a domain in PDDL as well as several problems that fall in that domain. You will be given a zip folder, pddl_template.zip, containing a template file for the domain as well as template files for the problems you are expected to implement.
